# ü§ñ Nflow Chat Assistant API

An intelligent multi-agent system for interacting with the Nflow platform to create and manage applications, database schemas, UI layouts, and automation flows through natural language.

## Features

- üß† **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Purpose-built agents specializing in different aspects of the Nflow platform
- ü§ù **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** - Interactive clarification requests when information is ambiguous or missing
- üìä **Database Schema Design** - Intelligent object and field creation with relationship modeling
- üñ•Ô∏è **UI Layout Creation** - Generate application layouts and pages from descriptions
- üîÑ **Automation Flow Building** - Create complex workflows with triggers and actions
- üíæ **Persistent Memory** - Session-based context management for coherent conversations
- üîç **Intent Recognition** - Convert natural language requests into structured task plans

## Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent approach where each agent specializes in a specific domain:

| Agent                 | Responsibility                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Coordinator Agent** | Central orchestrator that routes tasks, manages memory and HITL, and invokes other agents. |
| **Classifier Agent**  | Classify the user message and route to the correct workflow.                               |
| **Intent Agent**      | Converts user prompts into a structured intent plan (task DAG).                            |
| **Executor Agent**    | Receives normalized tool calls from agents and triggers real Nflow API requests.           |
| **Object Agent**      | Expert in database design and object schema on the Nflow platform.                         |
| **Application Agent** | Creates or updates Nflow applications.                                                     |
| **Layout Agent**      | Creates and manages UI layout/pages in Nflow.                                              |
| **Flow Agent**        | Builds automation flows with triggers and actions.                                         |
