# Product Requirements Document: User and Chat Session Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing user management with Keycloak Single Sign-On (SSO) integration and associating chat sessions with users. The goal is to enhance security, provide a personalized user experience, and ensure data privacy by restricting access to chat sessions based on ownership.

## 2. Goals

- Integrate Keycloak SSO for robust user authentication and management.
- Associate chat sessions with authenticated users.
- Ensure users can only access their own chat sessions and related data (e.g., messages).
- Provide a seamless login/logout experience via Keycloak.
- Maintain a clear relationship between users and their chat data in the database.

## 3. Target Users

- End-users of the NFlow AI Assistant platform.

## 4. User Stories

- **As a user, I want to log in to the application using my Keycloak credentials so that I can securely access my chat sessions.**
- **As a user, I want the application to remember my login session so that I don't have to log in every time I visit.**
- **As a user, I want to have multiple chat sessions so that I can organize my conversations by topic or project.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my past chat sessions so that I can easily find and continue them.**
- **As a user, I want to be sure that only I can access my chat sessions and messages so that my data remains private.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to log out of the application, which should also log me out from Keycloak SSO, so that my session is completely terminated.**
- **As an administrator, I want user accounts to be managed through Keycloak so that we can centralize user identity and access management.**

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1. Functional Requirements

- **FR1: User Authentication via Keycloak**
  - The system must integrate with Keycloak for user authentication.
  - Users should be redirected to Keycloak for login.
  - Upon successful authentication, Keycloak should redirect back to the application with necessary tokens.
  - The application must handle the Keycloak callback, validate tokens, and establish a user session.
  - User information (e.g., user ID, email) from Keycloak should be stored or accessible by the application.
- **FR2: User Session Management**
  - The application must maintain user sessions after successful login.
  - Session data should include Keycloak access tokens, refresh tokens, and user identifiers.
  - Implement token refresh mechanism using Keycloak refresh tokens to maintain active sessions.
  - Implement a secure logout mechanism that invalidates the application session and initiates Keycloak logout.
- **FR3: Chat Session Ownership**
  - Each chat session must be associated with a specific user.
  - When a new chat session is created, it must be linked to the currently authenticated user.
- **FR4: Access Control for Chat Sessions**
  - Users must only be able to list, view, update, or delete their own chat sessions.
  - Access to chat messages and other related data (e.g., agent results, generated apps) within a chat session must be restricted to the owner of that chat session.
  - API endpoints related to chat sessions and their contents must enforce ownership checks.
- **FR5: User Identification in Chat Data**
  - The database schema for `ChatSession` must include a reference to the user who owns it (e.g., `userId`).

### 5.2. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1: Security**
  - All communication with Keycloak must use HTTPS.
  - Sensitive tokens (access, refresh) must be stored securely (e.g., in HTTP-only session cookies or a secure backend store).
  - Implement CSRF protection for relevant endpoints.
  - User IDs from Keycloak should be used consistently to identify users.
- **NFR2: Performance**
  - Authentication and authorization checks should have minimal impact on API response times.
- **NFR3: Scalability**
  - The authentication and authorization mechanism should scale with an increasing number of users and chat sessions.
- **NFR4: Usability**
  - The login and logout process should be intuitive and straightforward for users.

## 6. Data Model Changes

- The `ChatSession` model needs to be updated to include a `userId` field (or similar) to link it to a user. This `userId` will likely be the `sub` (subject) claim from the Keycloak ID token.
- A new `User` model might not be strictly necessary in the application's database if user profile information is primarily managed and retrieved from Keycloak. However, storing the Keycloak `userId` in the `ChatSession` table is essential.

## 7. Out of Scope

- User registration through the application itself (Keycloak will handle user provisioning).
- Advanced role-based access control (RBAC) beyond basic ownership (initially).
- User profile management within the application (Keycloak will be the source of truth).

## 8. Success Metrics

- Successful integration with Keycloak SSO.
- Users can log in and out seamlessly.
- Chat sessions are correctly associated with users.
- Users can only access their own chat data.
- Reduction in unauthorized access attempts (if measurable).
- Positive user feedback on the authentication experience.
