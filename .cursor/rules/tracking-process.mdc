## Project Progress Tracking

### Guidelines for Progress Tracking

- Use the `docs/project-roadmap.md` file to track overall project progress
- Mark tasks as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[V]` (not the traditional `[x]`)
- Maintain accurate progress percentages in the tracking section
- When completing a task:
  1. Update its checkbox from `[ ]` to `[V]`
  2. Update the phase completion count (e.g., "Phase 1: 1/13 completed (8%)")
  3. Update the total progress percentage
- Keep the roadmap up-to-date as requirements evolve
- Add detailed subtasks as needed while keeping the main tasks intact

### Progress Review Process

- Review progress weekly
- Add comments or notes below completed tasks if necessary
- If a task is blocked, mark it with `[B]` and add a note explaining why
- If a task needs revision, mark it with `[R]` and describe the necessary changes

### Progress Commands

When using VSCode or Cursor editors, you can use the following commands to update progress:
- Find all incomplete tasks: Search for `- [ ]`
- Find all completed tasks: Search for `- [V]`
- Find all blocked tasks: Search for `- [B]`
- Find all tasks needing revision: Search for `- [R]`

### Integration with CI/CD

When possible, automate the progress tracking:
- On successful test runs, automatically mark test-related tasks as complete
- On successful deployments, automatically mark deployment tasks as complete
- Generate progress reports automatically as part of CI/CD pipeline
