## ‚úÖ Notes

- Use `"onRecordCreate"` for automations triggered when a record is created.
- Use `"onFormSubmit"` for UI-based flows like submission redirects.
- The `name` should be a slug (kebab-case), and `displayName` should match the original input.
- Include flow logic under `flowItems` using simplified type and intent.
